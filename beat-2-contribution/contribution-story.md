# Contribution: error copying NVDA user settings

Path: `beat-2-contribution/contribution-story.md`

This file is Assignment 5, and it is graded at the path above; a copy kept anywhere else in
the repository is not read. **Keep every section header below under its exact name** — the
format criteria grade exactly that. Your course repo link is the whole submission: no tool
files and no evidence uploads are part of Assignment 5.

**Contribution Number:** 1
**Student:** Tanyieleke Nkolaka
**GitHub Username:** b-tanyileke
**Issue:** https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/20118
**Pull Request:** Pending

One repository, built across units 5 to 8, telling the whole story of your real
contribution. Fill it as you work, not at the end — the sections below ask for evidence that
is far easier to write down as it happens than to reconstruct in the last weekend.

Contribution Number stays `[1]` unless you make more than one contribution this term; it
just numbers them.

## Toolkit

Every story section below, from Why I Chose This Issue through Pull
Request, ends with a Toolkit block: which tool did that phase's work
and how you used it, what it produced, what difficulties or
shortcomings it presented, and what you changed or would change
because of them. Together the blocks are the thread the rubric's
Toolkit points read, and they are the raw material for your unit-9
portfolio, so keep them current as you work rather than
reconstructing them later.

A Toolkit block looks like this (copy it into each story section and
fill it there):

```text
**Toolkit**

- Tool: [which tool did this phase's work, and how you used it]
- What it produced: [described in a sentence or a short excerpt]
- Difficulties: [what fought you or fell short, or "none met"]
- What changed: [the patch, revision, or workaround, what you would
  update, or "nothing"]
```

This section also keeps one short dated entry per week of tool work,
starting below: what you built or changed that week, what broke, and
what you changed because of it. The blocks tell the story where it
happened; these entries are the toolkit's own timeline.

All four entries are graded. Keep every heading below, and fill each
one in the week it belongs to.

**Unit 5: Built and tested an issue-scout for finding and grading first-contribution candidates**

I extended my issue-selection skill into an issue-scout with my fit profile, four GitHub search queries, ranking filters, and a grading rubric. The initial scan prioritized brand-new, zero-comment issues, which made it select an issue that gained a pull request within ten minutes of creation. So I added `createdAt` to every query and excluded issues younger than two full days. Direct-grading three candidates from the course’s Issue Selection site accepted NVDA #20118 and exposed additional gaps around agent-assigned issues, maintainer attitudes toward AI-assisted work, and fixes blocked by another repository; those were recorded as future rubric improvements in scan-notes.md.

**Unit 6: [one line on the tool work]**

[2-4 sentences: the voice-guard, the repo-memory file. What broke or
fell short, and what changed because of it. "Nothing broke" counts when
it is true - say how you know.]

**Unit 7: [one line on the tool work]**

[2-4 sentences: the ship-gate and your gate manifest. What it produced
on your real branch, what fought you, what changed because of it.]

**Unit 8: [one line on the tool work]**

[2-4 sentences: the PR-monitor and your playbook. What it read, what it
drafted, what you did with the draft.]

## Why I Chose This Issue

I found this issue through the course's Issue Selection site and graded it with my issue-scout before choosing it. The scout accepted it and rated it as moderate difficulty. The repository is active, a maintainer suggested retrying the file copy, and the issue is limited to one identifiable behavior in `installer.tryCopyFile`.

This issue fits my profile because it is a focused Python bug which I can attempt on my Windows 11 pc. This will help me practice reproducing a specific file handling problem in an established codebase. The scout pointed out that though the likely code change is small, reproducing the locked-file behavior is the harder part. The scout's scope check was too strict about issues with open questions, so I replaced it with `scope-feasible` and added a difficulty note.

**Toolkit**

- Tool: I used issue-scout to grade candidates from the Issue Selection site against my fit profile and rubric, then regraded them after applying the Unit 6 scope patch.
- What it produced: It accepted NVDA #20118, rated it as moderate difficulty, identified the likely `installer.tryCopyFile` area, and warned me about an abandoned earlier attempt and the testing evidence maintainers had requested.
- Difficulties: The original scope check treated unresolved questions like rejection reasons instead of increasing difficulty.
- What changed: I replaced `Scope is bounded` with `scope-feasible` and added straightforward, moderate, and ambitious difficulty notes.

## Reproduction Process

**Environment Setup**

[What a stranger would need to stand this up: your operating system,
the relevant versions (language, runtime, package manager, the project
itself), and how you set the project up. Then the challenges you faced
and how you solved them, or that none came up.]

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Observed result]

**Reproduction Evidence**

- **Commit showing reproduction:** [link to commit in your fork]
- **Screenshots/logs:** [if applicable]
- **My findings:** [what you discovered during reproduction; an
  honest, evidenced cannot-reproduce that led you to re-pick or ask
  the maintainer belongs here and costs you nothing]

## Solution Approach

**Analysis**

[Your analysis of the root cause: what is causing the issue, traced
to the files and functions involved.]

**Proposed Solution**

[High-level description of your fix approach, and what you are
deliberately NOT changing.]

**Implementation Plan**

1. [Modify file X to do Y]
2. [Add or change Z]
3. [Update tests]

[Record deviations here as they happen: what changed mid-build and
why. A recorded deviation is honest work; silent drift is not.]

- What it produced:
- Difficulties:

## Testing Strategy

[What observable checks prove the fix: your reproduction steps re-run
against the built change (before and after), and the repo's own test
suite or checks with the outcome shown. "Tests pass" with nothing
observable named is not a strategy.]

## Pull Request

**PR Link:** [GitHub PR URL when opened]

**PR Description:** [what the PR says; much of the content above
adapts into it]

**Maintainer Feedback:**

- [Date]: [feedback received, or "none yet"; silence is a normal
  state and costs you nothing]
- [Date]: [how you addressed it]

**Status:** [Awaiting review / Iterating / Merged / Closed. The
status is a fact you record, never a grade: the PR is graded as
opened.]

## Learnings and Reflections

**Technical Skills Gained**

[What you learned technically, named concretely.]

**Challenges Overcome**

[What was hard and how you solved it; point at the real events, the
Toolkit blocks above are full of them.]

**What I'd Do Differently Next Time**

[Reflection on your process.]

## Resources Used

[What actually helped, not a reading list. List things this story
already shows you using: the doc you followed to set the environment
up, the thread that explained the bug, the person who answered you.
One real entry beats ten plausible ones.]

- [Link to documentation that helped]
- [Discussion, issue, or post that helped]
